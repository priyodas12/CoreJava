In general, an immutable object can be made by defining a class which does not have any of its members exposed,
and does not have any setters.

The following class will create an immutable object

class ImmutableInt {
  private final int value;

  public ImmutableInt(int i) {
    value = i;
  }

  public int getValue() {
    return value;
  }
}

Advantage of Immutability:

Caching purpose
Concurrent environment (ThreadSafe)
Hard for inheritance
Value cannot be changed in any environment
